# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

one:
  id: 1
  email: one@localhost.net
  encrypted_password: <%= User.new.send(:password_digest, 'pass12345') %>

two:
  id: 2
  email: two@localhost.net
  encrypted_password: <%= User.new.send(:password_digest, 'pass12345') %>
